"""DP-aware durable ack: gather every rank's sample_ids, record ONCE.

With data-parallel consumers each rank trains a disjoint shard, but the durable
``{acked, global_step, optimizer_durable}`` marker must have a single writer —
otherwise N ranks interleave partial ack sets into one ledger.
:class:`DPAckController` keeps the write single-authority without giving up the
existing trainer seam: ``TrainerController.fit`` already calls ``ack_fn`` on
EVERY rank at EVERY optimizer boundary (in lockstep), so ``ack_train_refs``
becomes a collective — all ranks contribute their shard's ids
(``all_gather_object``), only the authority (DP rank 0) records the union and
drives the ``ack_sink`` (the producer-backpressure counter).

Correctness rests on the lockstep invariant the :class:`RefDistributor`
enforces (equal per-rank ref counts): a rank that skipped a boundary would hang
the gather.
