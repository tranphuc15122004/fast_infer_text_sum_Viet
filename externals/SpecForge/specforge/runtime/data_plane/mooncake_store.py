"""Mooncake-backed tensor store for the disaggregated runtime.

``SharedDirFeatureStore`` (``disaggregated.py``) locked down the disaggregation
*contract* over a shared POSIX directory. ``MooncakeFeatureStore`` swaps that
transport for the Mooncake distributed object store (RDMA zero-copy across
nodes) **behind the exact same FeatureStore API** — the control/training planes
see nothing new. The producer (rollout/ingest) ``put()``s feature tensors into
the Mooncake store on one node; the consumer (trainer) ``get()``s them on
another, peer-to-peer, with no shared filesystem. That is what makes this a
genuine network object store rather than a shared mount.

The wire contract is intentionally singular: every tensor is transferred as a
raw buffer with ``put_from``/``get_into``. Shape and dtype travel in the
metadata-only :class:`SampleRef`; no serialized tensor blob is accepted or
produced. Construction fails immediately when the installed Mooncake client
does not expose that API.

Contract carried from the reference backend:

* **B5 — no use-after-free.** ``get()`` after ``release``/``abort`` raises
  ``KeyError``; a generation guard rejects a stale ref after a re-``put``;
  clone-on-fetch is the default.
* **B9 — auth in disaggregated mode** (shared-secret :class:`AuthPolicy`).

Lifetime: Mooncake's default eviction is approximate-LRU for a KV *cache*, which
would silently drop a committed-but-unacked feature when the trainer lags hours
(turning ``get()`` into a ``KeyError`` and violating the controller's
no-data-loss guarantee). When Mooncake exposes ``with_hard_pin``, SpecForge
therefore **hard-pins** every object on ``put`` and frees it only by explicit
``remove()`` on consume/abort — SpecForge is the sole lifetime authority, not
Mooncake's LRU. Older and Ascend Mooncake clients may not expose that field; the
store logs a warning and inherits their default pin behavior, so deployments
that require the strict no-eviction guarantee must use a hard-pin-capable
client. Because ``remove()`` is a real (fallible) RPC, ``release()`` parks a
failed free in ``_release_pending`` and ``gc()`` retries up to
``max_release_attempts`` during steady state. Lifecycle shutdown calls
:meth:`drain_pending_removals`, a separate bounded retry that raises if physical
removal never succeeds; failed removals are never silently dropped from
bookkeeping.

Concurrency: ``release``/``abort``/``gc`` hold ``self._lock`` across the
``remove()`` RPC. The lock is what makes consume-once free race-free against a
concurrent ``get()`` (it prevents a re-lease between "decide to free" and the
remote delete), exactly as ``SharedDirFeatureStore`` holds its lock across
``os.remove``. For the offline single-consumer path this is fine; a high-fanout
online deployment that wants the ``remove()`` RPC off the critical section needs
a tombstone-then-free protocol — a follow-up tied to the shared metadata index.

    """A disaggregated :class:`FeatureStore` backed by the Mooncake store.

    **Zero-copy transport.** One Mooncake object per
    *tensor*, keyed ``{store_id}/{sample_id}/g{gen}/{name}``. ``put()`` writes each
    tensor straight from its storage with ``put_from(ptr)``; ``get()`` reads each
    straight into a tensor allocated from the ref's ``FeatureSpec`` with
    ``get_into(ptr)``. Tensors are never serialized on the wire: shape/dtype
    travel on the ref, while each object's value is the raw tensor buffer. The
    generation lives in the key (like ``SharedDirFeatureStore``'s filename
    generation), so a re-put supersedes the old key set and a stale ref's keys
    are gone -> ``get()`` raises (B5).

    ``store`` may be injected (any object exposing the Mooncake method subset:
    ``is_exist``/``remove``/``put_from``/``get_into``) so the contract is
    unit-testable without a running master. An incompatible backend is rejected
    during construction rather than selected as a different transport.
    An injected backend's owner must ensure its transport supports device reads
    when selecting ``receive_buffers="cuda"``; setup kwargs apply only to owned
    connections, whose effective protocol is validated here.
