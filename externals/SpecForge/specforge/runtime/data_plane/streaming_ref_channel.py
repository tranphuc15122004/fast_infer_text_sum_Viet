"""StreamingRefChannel: a cross-process, append-only ``SampleRef`` stream.

The offline disaggregation path hands the consumer a *static* ref manifest
(:func:`disagg_ingest.write_ref_manifest`) written once before training. The
*online* disaggregated path needs the opposite: the rollout producer commits
refs continuously while the trainer consumes them, on a different node. This is
that control-plane channel.

* **Tensor-free.** Only ``SampleRef`` metadata travels here (asserted on
  publish); the feature tensors go through the ``FeatureStore`` (Mooncake), so a
  shared *data* mount is never required -- only this small control file.
* **Append-only JSONL.** ``publish()`` appends one ref per line and fsyncs;
  ``poll()`` tail-reads complete lines from the last offset, buffering a partial
  trailing line so a reader never parses a half-written record.
* **Consume-once friendly.** The reader marks how many refs it has consumed
  (``mark_consumed``) in a sidecar counter the writer reads back, so the producer
  can apply backpressure (``in_flight_remote``) without any shared in-process
  state -- the same split-process model as the rest of disaggregation.
* **Explicit outcome.** ``close()`` drops an EOF sentinel only for a successful
  producer. ``fail()`` publishes the producer exception separately, so a remote
  trainer cannot mistake a truncated rollout for a normal end of input.
* **Peer stop.** The consumer publishes done/failed sentinels. A producer that is
  blocked on its in-flight watermark can then stop without process supervision.

This is the framework, intentionally filesystem-backed (works over any shared
control mount). A networked control plane (Redis/the durable MetadataStore)
slots in behind the same publish/poll API later.
