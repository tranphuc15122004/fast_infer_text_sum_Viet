"""Disaggregated offline producer: ingest features into a shared FeatureStore.

This is the *producer* half of an offline disaggregated run. It reads SpecForge
offline feature files (``.ckpt`` / ``.ckpt.gz``) and ``put()``s each one into a
:class:`SharedDirFeatureStore` that lives on a filesystem both pools share. The
tensors land in the store (shared mount); the returned ``SampleRef``s are
tensor-free metadata, which is all the consumer (trainer) needs to fetch them.

The ref set is the only thing that must cross the producer→consumer boundary, so
it is serialized as a small JSON **manifest** — the disaggregated analogue of the
in-process ``OfflineManifestReader.read()`` list. The control-plane invariant
(metadata only, never tensors) is asserted before the manifest is written.
