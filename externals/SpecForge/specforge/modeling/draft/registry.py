"""Draft-architecture registry: the extension point for new draft model classes.

A draft *architecture* (the model class) is a separate axis from an immutable
algorithm registration: one architecture can train under several algorithms
and vice versa. Registering a class here makes it constructible from a
draft-config JSON whose
``architectures[0]`` names it — adding an architecture is a new file plus
``@register_draft``, not an edit to ``modeling/auto.py``.
