## 📍 Overview

SpecForge is an ecosystem project developed by the SGLang team. It is a framework for training speculative decoding models so that you can smoothly port them over to the SGLang serving framework to speed up your inference.

We have seen many open-source projects for speculative decoding, but most of them are not well-maintained or not directly compatible with SGLang. We prepared this project because we wish that the open-source community can enjoy a speculative decoding framework that is

- regularly maintained by the SpecForge team: the code is runnable out-of-the-box
- directly compatible with SGLang: no additional porting effort is required
- able to run online disaggregated training and both colocated and
  disaggregated offline training through one runtime, including the supported
  data, tensor, and sequence parallel topologies


Check out [**our documentation**](https://docs.sglang.io/SpecForge/) to get started.


## 🔧 Supported Methods

Every method uses the same typed training entry point:

```bash
specforge train --config examples/configs/online/disaggregated/external/qwen3-8b-eagle3-disaggregated.yaml
```

The path under `examples/configs` identifies feature mode, topology, and online
service ownership. The command above uses an `external` recipe: SpecForge
supervises the producer and consumer on one trainer node, while the user or
scheduler owns Mooncake and SGLang. Recipes under `managed-local` also start
those services on the local host. Online target parallelism belongs to SGLang;
`deployment.trainer` owns trainer DP and offline EAGLE3 USP process groups.
There are no method-specific Python training entry points.

See the [training guide](./docs/sections/basic_usage/training.md) for the supported
method/topology matrix and the
[disaggregated guide](./docs/sections/basic_usage/disaggregated_training.md) for the
online/offline launch workflows. Unsupported combinations are rejected during
config validation or run assembly instead of falling back to an older trainer.


## 🚀 Accelerate with SpecBundle

SpecBundle is a collection of production-grade speculative decoding models that are released by the SpecForge team and our industry partners. They provide higher acceptance rate compared to the existing open-source checkpoints over a wide range of domains. Together with SGLang, you can experience up to 4x speedup for inference.
